## 🎯 What's Inside

| Skill | Who It's For | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| [**Research Critic**](research-critic/) | PhD students & researchers | Tears apart dental papers — methodology flaws, bias detection, statistical errors, citation quality |
| [**Clinical Evidence Reviewer**](clinical-evidence-reviewer/) | Clinicians | Grades treatment evidence (Level I–V), flags outdated protocols, checks if conclusions match data |
| [**Dental Content Creator**](dental-content-creator/) | Educators & marketers | Turns complex science into patient-friendly content and social media posts |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Claude Desktop
1. Copy the `SKILL.md` from any skill folder
2. Add it to your Claude Desktop project as a knowledge file
3. Start prompting — the skill instructions guide Claude automatically

### Codex CLI
1. Copy the `SKILL.md` into your working directory
2. Reference it in your prompt: *"Follow the instructions in SKILL.md to analyze this paper..."*

### Claude Code / OpenClaw
1. Place the skill folder in your workspace
2. The `SKILL.md` is auto-detected as project context

## 📋 Skills Overview

### 🔬 Research Critic
The peer reviewer you wish you had. Feed it a dental research paper and get:
- **Methodology audit** — sample size adequacy, randomization issues, blinding problems
- **Statistical review** — p-value fishing, inappropriate tests, missing confidence intervals
- **Bias detection** — discussion spin, cherry-picked citations, narrative fitting
- **Conflict of interest flags** — funding source analysis, author affiliations
- **Study design grading** — RCT vs cohort vs case series, with CONSORT/STROBE compliance
- **Structured output** with severity ratings (🔴 Critical / 🟡 Moderate / 🟢 Minor)

### 📊 Clinical Evidence Reviewer
Evidence-based decision support for chairside clinicians:
- **Evidence grading** (Level I–V) for treatment protocols
- **Head-to-head comparisons** of treatment options with current literature
- **Outdated recommendation alerts** — flags guidelines older than 5 years without updates
- **Data-conclusion matching** — checks if the paper's conclusions are actually supported

### ✍️ Dental Content Creator
Turn dense science into content people actually read:
- **Patient education materials** — leaflets, FAQs, post-op instructions
- **Social media posts** — LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter/X formats
- **Scientific-to-plain-language translation** — ELI5 for dental topics
- **Evidence-based approach** — every claim linked to current literature
